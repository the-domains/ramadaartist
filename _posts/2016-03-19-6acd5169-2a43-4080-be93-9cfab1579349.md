This is the website for the artist Matthew J Ramada.  
This website has been designed by robots, because I love them, and I am curious to see how well they treat my art. Be nice to them, enjoy the website, it will probably change as time goes on.  
Hello Universe!  
Peace, Love, Grace and Thanks,  
-Matthew
