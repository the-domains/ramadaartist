These are some fractal space images I made with a program that makes fractal spaces. I call them "Pandora's Box." I made them in an attempt to woo a lady during online dating. It did not work. (Which is fine, I have found a much nicer lady in the meantime.)

These following images are made in Microsoft Paint. I like to try and use all different kinds of tools to make art with, and I like to be inventive in what I can use to make art. I found out very recently (in like, February of 2016,) that MSPaint can actually be as interesting of an art tool as something more intentionally sophisticated like Photoshop. I will probably combine programs in the future to make even more complex images, by starting with MSPaint to make an initial image and then using Photoshop to perform additional image work on top of it. (Photoshop is a good tool to finalize images in, because it has so many variables that you can precisely control, if you know how to use them.)
